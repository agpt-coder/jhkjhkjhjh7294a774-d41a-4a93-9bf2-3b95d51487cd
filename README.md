# jhkjhkjhjh

To create a single API endpoint capable of taking in a string LLM prompt and returning a refined version through GPT-4, we will employ the tech stack specified with Python as our programming language, FastAPI for the API framework, PostgreSQL for the database, and Prisma as the ORM. The process starts by setting up a FastAPI project, then integrating the OpenAI Python package to communicate with the GPT-4 model for prompt refinement. Users will submit their prompts to this endpoint, which then forwards the prompt to GPT-4 via the OpenAI package, receives the refined prompt, and returns this to the user.

Key steps include:
1. Setup a FastAPI project and ensure it can run locally.
2. Install the OpenAI Python package using `pip install openai`.
3. Configure the OpenAI package with your API key using `openai.api_key = 'your-api-key-here'`.
4. Create an API endpoint `/refine_prompt` that accepts a POST request with the user's prompt as JSON.
5. Implement logic in the endpoint to take the user's prompt, send it to GPT-4 using the OpenAI package with the operation `openai.Completion.create(engine='gpt-4', prompt=user_prompt, ...)` and parameters tailored to prompt refinement.
6. Return the refined prompt received from GPT-4 back to the client.

Proper error handling should be implemented to manage potential issues with API requests either to your service or from your service to OpenAI. Additionally, consider security measures to protect your API key and user data.

## What you'll need to run this
* An unzipper (usually shipped with your OS)
* A text editor
* A terminal
* Docker
  > Docker is only needed to run a Postgres database. If you want to connect to your own
  > Postgres instance, you may not have to follow the steps below to the letter.


## How to run 'jhkjhkjhjh'

1. Unpack the ZIP file containing this package

2. Adjust the values in `.env` as you see fit.

3. Open a terminal in the folder containing this README and run the following commands:

    1. `poetry install` - install dependencies for the app

    2. `docker-compose up -d` - start the postgres database

    3. `prisma generate` - generate the database client for the app

    4. `prisma db push` - set up the database schema, creating the necessary tables etc.

4. Run `uvicorn project.server:app --reload` to start the app

## How to deploy on your own GCP account
1. Set up a GCP account
2. Create secrets: GCP_EMAIL (service account email), GCP_CREDENTIALS (service account key), GCP_PROJECT, GCP_APPLICATION (app name)
3. Ensure service account has following permissions: 
    Cloud Build Editor
    Cloud Build Service Account
    Cloud Run Developer
    Service Account User
    Service Usage Consumer
    Storage Object Viewer
4. Remove on: workflow, uncomment on: push (lines 2-6)
5. Push to master branch to trigger workflow
